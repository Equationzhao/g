```nu
# add the following to your $nu.env-path
^g --init nushell | save -f ~/.g.nu
# then add the following to your $nu.config-path
source ~/.g.nu

# if you want to replace nushell's g command with g
# add the following definition and alias to your $nu.config-path
#
# def nug [arg?] {
#     if ($arg == null) {
#         g $arg
#     } else {
