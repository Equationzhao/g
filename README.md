## Shell Integration

### completion

>> *if you install `g` through brew or the install script, the completion is usually installed already.*

#### zsh
```zsh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Equationzhao/g/master/completions/zsh/_g
```

install the file to your zsh completion directory, usually `/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions` or `/usr/share/zsh/site-functions` (or anywhere in your $FPATH)

```zsh
mv _g ~/.zsh/completions
```

make sure `autoload -Uz compinit` and `compinit` are in the `~/.zshrc` or `~/.zprofile`

if not, add them to at least one of them.

```zsh
autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
```

#### bash

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Equationzhao/g/master/completions/bash/g-completion.bash
```

add the following lines to your ~/.bashrc file:

```bash
source /path/to/g-completion.bash
```

#### fish

```fish
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Equationzhao/g/master/completions/fish/g.fish
```

Install the file to your fish completion directory, usually ~/.config/fish/completions

```fish
mv g.fish ~/.config/fish/completions
```

Restart your terminal session or run the following command to immediately enable the completion functionality:

```fish
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

### alias

Generate initialization scripts(alias) for various shells:

```bash
g -init bash/zsh/fish/pwsh
```

##### bash

```.bash
# add the following command to .bashrc
eval "$(g --init bash)"
# then `source ~/.bashrc`
```

##### zsh

```zsh
# add the following command to .zshrc
eval "$(g --init zsh)"
# then `source ~/.zshrc`
```

##### fish

```fish
#  add to fish config:
g --init fish | source
#  then `source ~/.config/fish/config.fish`
```

##### powershell

```powershell
# add the following line to your profile
Invoke-Expression (& { (g --init powershell | Out-String) })
```

use command `echo $profile` to find your profile path

##### nushell

the nushell has a nice built-in ls command, but if you wanna try `g` in nushell, you can do the following:

ps: the script is not guaranteed to work, if you have any problem, please [file an issue](https://github.com/Equationzhao/g/issues/new/choose)

```nu
# add the following to your $nu.env-path
^g --init nushell | save -f ~/.g.nu
# then add the following to your $nu.config-path
source ~/.g.nu

# if you want to replace nushell's g command with g
# add the following definition and alias to your $nu.config-path
#
# def nug [arg?] {
#     if ($arg == null) {
#         g $arg
#     } else {
#         g
#     }
# }
# alias g = ^g
```
